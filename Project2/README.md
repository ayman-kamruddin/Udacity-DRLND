# Udacity-DRL-ND-Project2

Solution files for project 2 (continuous control). Set up local environment as per https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning, download multi-reacher Unity executable from https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p2_continuous-control, run python main.py

My code extensively used previous code from the Udacity course.
