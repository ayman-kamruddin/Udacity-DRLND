# Project 1: Navigation
Solution files for the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano-Degree Project 1

## Overview

This project is part of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree and focuses on training a deep reinforcement learning agent to navigate and collect bananas in a Unity environment. The goal is to implement and train an agent using deep Q-learning to achieve a high score in the given environment.


## Project Details:

The state space is 37 in size and the action space is 4 in size. The environment is considered solved when the reward is +13, obtained in less than 1800 training episodes.


## Instructions:

Once requisite packages are installed, simply run the single python notebook to train and see the results.


## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **`Navigation.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the deep Q-learning agent and exploring the environment.

- **`DRLND_Report_Project_1.pdf`**:  A report summarizing the implementation details, training results, and possible future improvements.

- **`model.pth`**:  File with saved model weights

## Getting Started

pip install should work for all packages required. An environment with Python 3.6 is needed. Make sure you have the banana environment downloaded in the directory. Follow these steps to get started with the Navigation project:

1. Open and run the `Navigation.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and evaluate the deep Q-learning agent.
