# Udacity-DRL-ND-Project1
Solution files for the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano-Degree Project 1

Project Details:

The state space is 37 in size and the action space is 4 in size. The environment is considered solved when the reward is +13, obtained in less than 1800 training episodes.

Getting Started: 

pip install should work for all packages required. An environment with Python 3.6 is needed. Make sure you have the banana environment downloaded in the directory.

Instructions:

Once requisite packages are installed, simply run the single python notebook to train and see the results.

Results:
model.pth file with saved weights, and figure in the repo.

Disclaimer: I have made heavy usage of code scripts from earlier on in the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano-Degree program.
